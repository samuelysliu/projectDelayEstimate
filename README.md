# projectDelayEstimate
As the number of projects and bugs continues to accumulate, I predict that if the company does not deal with development issues quickly and continues to accept new projects, it will cause serious delays in all projects.
Therefore, I conducted a time series analysis and told the company that at a certain point in time, the project backlog would lead to development delays and serious overtime based on past experience.
